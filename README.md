# Basic WP Theme Generator

Do you build custom WordPress themes regularly? Are you sick of running a find/replace on your entire project to make it unique to your client? Then this application is for you. Simply fill out the required fields and generate a very basic WordPress theme built on top of the Twitter Bootstrap framework. The generated theme will include a robust package.json file with a preconfigured Gruntfile for preprocessing SCSS and other helpful functions, as well as a few useful PHP snippets. The theme will not include any prebuilt templates or pages, but rather give you the starting point to do so yourself.

## New:
* Object Oriented PHP version of the theme -- still in beta.
