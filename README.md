# Basic WP Theme Generator

Generate a very basic WordPress theme built on top of the Twitter Bootstrap framework. The generated theme will include a robust package.json file with a preconfigured Gruntfile for preprocessing SCSS and other helpful functions, as well as a few useful PHP snippets. The theme will not include any prebuilt templates or pages, but rather give you the starting point to do so yourself.
